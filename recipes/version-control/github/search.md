## Issues and Pull Requests

Note that _both_ Issues and Pull Requests will returned by default unless you opt for just the one type.

### Generic

Queries generated by GitHub when visiting these URLs.

- All issues
    - `is:open is:issue author:MichaelCurrin archived:false`
    - [github.com/issues](https://github.com/issues)
- All Pull Requests
    - `is:open is:pr author:MichaelCurrin archived:false`
    - [github.com/pulls](https://github.com/pulls)

### Open source

These are specifically configured for my own profile.

When measuring public open source contributions, I like to exclude acivity in repos which belong to me or my work (2U). Though only me doing the search or using a token with access to private repos will display private repos, whether my own or someone else's.

Also note that these only cover where I am an _author_. Not a reviewer or commenter on other users' contrbutions.

- Closed Issues created by MichaelCurrin in public repos (these may have been resolved or not)
