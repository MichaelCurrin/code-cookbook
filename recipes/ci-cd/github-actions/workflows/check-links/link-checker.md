# Link Checker action

[![GitHub Marketplace](https://img.shields.io/badge/Marketplace-Link%20Checker-blue.svg?colorA=24292e&colorB=0366d6&style=flat&longCache=true&logo=github)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/link-checker)

A GitHub action for link checking repository Markdown and HTML files.

_Note: I am not going to use this since the default gives an error as nothing on `*` and the expected subdirectory is not recognized. Perhaps this only works on a built site as that is an example where I saw this used._


## Usage

### Basic

- `main.yml`
    ```yaml
    steps:
    - name: Link Checker
      uses: peter-evans/link-checker@v1
    ```

### Custom args

Optionally pass arguments to [Liche](https://github.com/raviqqe/liche). Defaults shown here.

- `main.yml`
    ```yaml
    steps:
      - name: Link Checker
        uses: peter-evans/link-checker@v1
        with:
          args: -v -r *
    ```

Note that even on verbose mode, nothing is outputted on a success so you can't see that any URLs were checked.


### Create issues on error

When used in conjunction with [Create Issue From File](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-issue-from-file), issues will be created when Link Checker finds connectivity problems with links.

Based on the example from the Check Links docs.

- `main.yml`
    ```yaml
    name: Check markdown links

    on:
      schedule:
      - cron: '0 0 1 * *'

    jobs:
      link-checker:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2

          - name: Link Checker
            uses: peter-evans/link-checker@v1

          - name: Create Issue From File
            uses: peter-evans/create-issue-from-file@v2
            with:
              title: Link Checker Report
              content-filepath: ./link-checker/out.md
              labels: report, automated issue
    ```

### Fail on error

Add a step at the end.

- `main.yml`
    ```yaml
    steps:
      - name: Fail if there were link errors
        run: exit ${{ steps.lc.outputs.exit_code }}
    ```

### Run checks against output directory

This checks links the directory like `site`.

This runs against HTML files but it will still work.
