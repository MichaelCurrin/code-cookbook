# HTML Proofer

How to use a Ruby gem as a CLI tool to validate links in your static HTML, for both internal and external links.

You can run this on any directory of static HTML files, locally or with CI.

## Install

### Install gem globally

```sh
$ gem install html-proofer --user-install
```

This is if you are going to reuse across your projects or are going to use in CI. You'll get the latest version available.

### Install gem in project

This is for if you want to include in your project.

Use Bundler to add to your `Gemfile` and install it.

```sh
$ bundle add html-proofer --group "test"
```

Or add the following your `Gemfile` manually:

```ruby
gem "html-proofer", "~> 3.19", :group => :test
```

Then later you can install it like this, locally or in CI.

```sh
$ bundle install
```

### Use with Docker

See [html-proofer](https://hub.docker.com/r/klakegg/html-proofer) on Docker Hub.


## Usage

### 1. Build

Create your HTML output as usual.

e.g.

- Jekyll site.
    ```sh
    $ bundle exec jekyll build
    ```
- NPM app.
    ```sh
    $ npm run build
    ```

### 2. Run checks

Run the tool against your output directory, like `_site` or `build`.

#### Global level

If you installed globally, then run:

```sh
$ htmproofer _site
```

#### Project level

```sh
$ bundle exec htmlproofer _site
```

```
Running ["ScriptCheck", "LinkCheck", "ImageCheck"] on ["_site"] on *.html...


Checking 1022 external links...
```


## Write to log files

The output can get very long, so you might want to write to log files which are ignored.

The tool prints `stdout` as a count of URLs and files (a few lines only). The `stdout` content is the actually check breakdown, which can very long.

Here, writing error output to `links.log`.

```sh
$ htmlproofer --assume-extension _site 2> links.log
```

It looks like if you give bad flags, the error message is printed and nothing goes to the file, even when using:

```
... > success.log 2> fail.log
```


## Usage

```sh
$ htmlproofer PATH [options]
```

If you omit the `PATH`, then it uses `.` for the current directory instead.

The docs recommend this:

```sh
$ htmlproofer _site
```

The output includes `_site` though.

Cleaner output and using `.` explicitly for clarity.

```sh
$ cd _site && htmlproofer .
```

If your site used a subpath like on GitHub Pages, then use the [URL swap](#url-swap) flag.

You can also run against a file.

```sh
$ htmlproofer _site/index.html
```


## Configuration

See [Configuration][] in the docs.

[Configuration]: https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer#configuration

See also output from:

```sh
$ htmlproofer --help
```

Some flag highlights are covered below.

### Log level

Set log level to debug.

e.g. `--log-level :debug`

Defaults to `:info` but you set `:debug`, `:info`, `:warn`, `:error`.

### URL swap

Provided one or more URLs to substitute with an escaped regex pattern and a value to use.

> A hash containing key-value pairs of `RegExp => String`. It transforms URLs that match `RegExp` into `String` via `gsub`.

- `--url-swap REGEX:VALUE`
- `--url-swap REGEX:VALUE,REGEX:VALUE,REGEX:VALUE,...`

Example from the docs:

```sh
$ htmlproofer --url-swap 'wow:cow,mow:doh'
```

For this Cookbook site which is built on Jekyll, the subpath is `/code-cookbook/` and this causes the internal URLs to all appear broken. So replace that with `/` as below.

```sh
$ htmlproofer --url '\/code-cookbook\/:/' _site/
```

### URL ignore

e.g.

```
--url-ignore github.com
```

### HTTP status ignore

- `--http_status_ignore`
    > An array of numbers representing status codes to ignore.

Defaults to empty array.

e.g. `--http-status-ignore "999,401,404"`

### Only 4XX

Defaults to false.

- `--only-4xx`
    > Only reports errors for links that fall within the 4xx status code range.

### Force HTTPS

- `--enforce-https`
    > Fails a link if it's not marked as https.

### Assume extension

- `--assume-extension`
    > Automatically add extension (e.g. `.html`) to file paths, to allow extensionless URLs

The docs recommend this for Jekyll.

### External and internal links

Even if you use the `link` tag to enforce local links at build time, it is still useful for the tool to check external links. In case you there are some case where you didn't use `link`.

Check internal links only.

- `--disable-external`
    > If true, does not run the external link checker, which can take a lot of time.

Check external links only.

- `--external-only`
    > Only checks problems with external references.


## Rakefile setup

For a Jekyll site, the docs recommend the following for use with `rake` if you want go that route.

- `Rakefile`
    ```ruby
    require 'html-proofer'

    task :test do
      sh "bundle exec jekyll build"
      options = { :assume_extension => true }
      HTMLProofer.check_directory("_site", options).run
    end
    ```

Then run as:

```sh
$ rake test
```
